# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing WhatsApp integration to consolidate duplicate services, fix API inconsistencies, and prepare the service for production use. The current implementation has two similar services with mixed APIs (Meta/Facebook and Twilio), syntax errors, and lacks proper validation and error handling. The refactored service will provide a robust, production-ready WhatsApp Business API integration with comprehensive validation, error handling, and retry mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single consolidated WhatsApp service, so that I can avoid code duplication and maintain consistency across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN there SHALL be only one WhatsApp service class
2. WHEN developers import WhatsApp functionality THEN they SHALL use a single, consistent API
3. WHEN the service is configured THEN it SHALL use only the Meta/Facebook WhatsApp Business API
4. IF there are existing references to multiple services THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into one service

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper configuration validation, so that I can ensure the service is correctly configured before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is initialized THEN it SHALL validate all required configuration parameters
2. IF phoneNumberId is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL throw a configuration error
3. IF accessToken is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL throw a configuration error
4. IF businessAccountId is missing THEN the system SHALL throw a configuration error
5. WHEN apiVersion is not provided THEN the system SHALL default to 'v17.0'
6. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want phone number validation, so that I can ensure messages are sent to valid WhatsApp numbers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a phone number is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the format
2. IF a phone number contains invalid characters THEN the system SHALL throw a validation error
3. IF a phone number is too short or too long THEN the system SHALL throw a validation error
4. WHEN a valid phone number is provided THEN the system SHALL format it consistently
5. WHEN phone number validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide descriptive error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want robust error handling and retry mechanisms, so that temporary failures don't cause message delivery failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL retry the request with exponential backoff
2. WHEN the maximum retry attempts are reached THEN the system SHALL throw a final error
3. IF an API rate limit is hit THEN the system SHALL wait and retry appropriately
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
5. IF a permanent error occurs (4xx) THEN the system SHALL NOT retry the request
6. WHEN temporary errors occur (5xx, network) THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want message content validation, so that I can ensure messages meet WhatsApp's requirements before sending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text messages are sent THEN the system SHALL validate message length limits
2. IF message content is empty THEN the system SHALL throw a validation error
3. WHEN template messages are sent THEN the system SHALL validate template name format
4. IF template components are invalid THEN the system SHALL throw a validation error
5. WHEN media messages are sent THEN the system SHALL validate file size and type
6. IF media validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging, so that I can monitor service health and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are sent successfully THEN the system SHALL log success with message ID
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with context
3. WHEN retries happen THEN the system SHALL log retry attempts and reasons
4. IF configuration issues occur THEN the system SHALL log configuration errors
5. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL log response status and timing
6. WHEN webhook processing occurs THEN the system SHALL log webhook events and processing results

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want webhook signature verification, so that I can ensure incoming webhooks are authentic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webhooks are received THEN the system SHALL verify the signature
2. IF webhook signature is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the webhook
3. WHEN signature verification passes THEN the system SHALL process the webhook
4. IF signature verification fails THEN the system SHALL log the security event
5. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types and interfaces, so that I can have type safety and better development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the service THEN all methods SHALL have proper TypeScript types
2. WHEN configuration is provided THEN it SHALL be validated against TypeScript interfaces
3. IF type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time errors
4. WHEN API responses are processed THEN they SHALL be typed according to WhatsApp API specifications
5. WHEN webhook data is processed THEN it SHALL have proper type definitions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want environment-based configuration, so that I can deploy the service across different environments securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service initializes THEN it SHALL read configuration from environment variables
2. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN configuration is overridden THEN explicit parameters SHALL take precedence over environment variables
4. IF sensitive data is logged THEN the system SHALL mask or redact it
5. WHEN different environments are used THEN the service SHALL adapt configuration accordingly

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want media handling capabilities, so that I can send and receive images, documents, and other media through WhatsApp.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN media is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file size and type
2. IF media upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages
3. WHEN media is downloaded THEN the system SHALL handle authentication properly
4. IF media URLs expire THEN the system SHALL handle re-authentication
5. WHEN media messages are sent THEN the system SHALL support captions and metadata
6. IF media processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms
